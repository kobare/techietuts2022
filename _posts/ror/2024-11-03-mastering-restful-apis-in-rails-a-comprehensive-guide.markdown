### Introduction

In the modern web development landscape, building robust and scalable RESTful 
APIs is a crucial skill for developers. These APIs serve as the backbone for 
communication between various components of a web application, enabling seamless 
integration with external services and providing data to different client 
applications. Ruby on Rails, a popular and powerful web framework, offers a 
comprehensive set of tools and conventions for creating RESTful APIs. In this 
section, we'll delve into the key aspects of building RESTful APIs with Rails, 
including versioning, authentication, pagination, rate limiting, and API 
documentation.



<br>
### Prerequisites

Before we dive into the details, make sure you have Ruby and Rails installed on 
your system. You can check their versions by running the following commands:

{% highlight terminal %}

ruby -v
rails -v

{% endhighlight %}

If you need to install Ruby or Rails, you can refer to the official installation 
guides for your specific operating system.



<br>
### Getting Started

Let's start by creating a new Rails application and setting up a basic RESTful 
API. We'll build an API for managing a collection of articles, which will have 
attributes like title, content, and author. We'll use the Rails generators to 
create the necessary components:

{% highlight terminal %}

# Create a new Rails application
rails new ArticleAPI

# Navigate to the application directory
cd ArticleAPI

# Generate the Article model
rails generate model Article title:string content:text author:string

# Run the database migration
rails db:migrate

# Generate the Articles controller
rails generate controller Articles

{% endhighlight %}


Now that we have the basic setup ready, let's move on to the core concepts of 
building RESTful APIs.



<br>
#### 1. Versioning

Versioning is essential to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions 
when you make changes to your API. Rails provides an elegant way to handle API 
versioning using namespaces. We'll create a v1 namespace for our API:

{% highlight ruby %}

# In routes.rb
namespace :api do
  namespace :v1 do
    resources :articles
  end
end

{% endhighlight %}


Now, the ArticlesController will be placed in the Api::V1 module. This structure 
allows us to add version-specific logic while keeping the older versions intact.


<br>
#### 2. Authentication

Securing your API is crucial to protect sensitive data and control access. Let's 
implement token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). We'll use the 
jwt gem for this purpose:

{% highlight ruby %}

# In Gemfile
gem 'jwt'

{% endhighlight %}


Run bundle install to install the gem.

{% highlight ruby %}

# In ApplicationController
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
  before_action :authenticate_request

  private

  def authenticate_request
    @current_user = Author.find_by(id: decoded_token['author_id']) if decoded_token
    render json: { error: 'Unauthorized' }, status: 401 unless @current_user
  end

  def decoded_token
    @decoded_token ||= JWT.decode(auth_token, Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base, true, algorithm: 'HS256')
  rescue JWT::DecodeError
    nil
  end

  def auth_token
    request.headers['Authorization'].split(' ').last if request.headers['Authorization'].present?
  end
end

{% endhighlight %}


This code sets up a simple JWT-based authentication mechanism. We assume that 
each article has an associated author (author_id). The authenticate_request 
method checks the token provided in the Authorization header and sets the 
@current_user variable accordingly.


<br>
#### 3. Pagination

When dealing with a large number of records, paginating the results is essential 
to improve performance and user experience. We'll use the kaminari gem for 
pagination:

{% highlight ruby %}

# In Gemfile
gem 'kaminari'

{% endhighlight %}


Run bundle install to install the gem.

{% highlight ruby %}

# In ArticlesController
class Api::V1::ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = Article.page(params[:page]).per(params[:per_page])
    render json: @articles
  end
end

{% endhighlight %}


In the code above, we use the page and per methods provided by Kaminari to 
paginate the articles.


<br>
#### 4. Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of your API, implementing rate limiting 
is a good practice. We'll use the rack-attack gem for this purpose:

{% highlight ruby %}

# In Gemfile
gem 'rack-attack'

{% endhighlight %}

Run bundle install to install the gem.


<br>
{% highlight ruby %}

# In config/application.rb
config.middleware.use Rack::Attack

# In config/initializers/rack_attack.rb
class Rack::Attack
  throttle('req/ip', limit: 5, period: 1.minute) do |req|
    req.ip
  end
end

{% endhighlight %}


This configuration limits the number of requests from a single IP address to 5 
requests per minute. You can adjust the limits as needed for your use case.
5. API Documentation

Documenting your API is essential for developers who will consume it. We'll use 
the swagger-rails gem to generate interactive API documentation:

{% highlight ruby %}

# In Gemfile
gem 'swagger-rails'

{% endhighlight %}

Run bundle install to install the gem.

{% highlight terminal %}

# Generate the Swagger configuration
rails generate swagger:install

{% endhighlight %}


You can now use Swagger annotations in your controllers to document the API 
endpoints and responses.



<br>
### Conclusion

Building robust and scalable RESTful APIs in Rails is a powerful skill that 
opens up numerous possibilities for integrating your application with external 
services. In this tutorial, we covered key concepts, including versioning, 
authentication, pagination, rate limiting, and API documentation. By mastering 
these techniques, you'll be well-equipped to create APIs that are secure, 
efficient, and well-documented, providing a solid foundation for your web 
applications.
