### Definition
Token-based authentication is a protocol which allows users to verify their identity, and in return receive a unique access token
to an electronically restricted resource, usually an application.


<br>
### Types of Token-Based Authentication

1 . Connected Tokens

Connected tokens are physical devices that users must plug in to their computer or system for authentication. Examples include smart cards and Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices, as well as discs, drives, and keys.


<br>
2 . Contactless Tokens

Contactless tokens uses a wireless connection to access the system. An example of this is Microsoftâ€™s ring device Token, which is a wearable ring that enables users to quickly and seamlessly log in to their Windows 10 device without entering a password.


<br>
3 . Disconnected Tokens

Disconnected tokens work by setting up a device to generate one-time access codes, which serve as part of 2FA or MFA. A good example of this is entering a code on a mobile phone for two-factor authentication (2FA).


<br> 
4 . JSON Web Token (JWT)

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) enable secure communication between two parties through 
an open industry standard, Request For Comments 7519 (RFC 7519). This defines a 
simple, self-contained method for transmitting information between parties securely.

JWT standard uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) objects to transmit tokens 
between parties and the data shared is verified by a digital signature using an 
algorithm and public and private key pairing, which ensures optimal security. 
Data sent via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is kept secure by encryption.
