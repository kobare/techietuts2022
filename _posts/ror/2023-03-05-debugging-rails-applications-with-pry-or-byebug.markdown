### Introduction

Debugging is an essential part of developing a Ruby on Rails application. 
It involves finding and fixing errors or bugs in the code. There are different 
techniques and tools for debugging Rails applications, but in this tutorial, 
we'll focus on two popular Ruby debugging tools: Pry and Byebug.


<br>
### What is Pry?

Pry is a powerful Ruby REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that allows us to interact 
with our code in real-time. We can use Pry to debug our Ruby code, inspect objects, 
and test code snippets. Pry provides several advanced features, including syntax 
highlighting, code introspection, and method discovery.


<br>
### What is Byebug?

Byebug is a fast and efficient Ruby debugger that allows us to debug our code 
interactively. Byebug provides a range of powerful features, including step-by-step 
execution, breakpoint management, and stack trace inspection.


<br>
### Installation

Before we can start using Pry or Byebug, we need to install them. To install 
them, add the following lines to your Gemfile:


<br>
{% highlight ruby %}

gem 'pry-rails'
gem 'byebug'

{% endhighlight %}



<br>
### Using Pry

Once Pry is installed, we can start using it to debug our Rails application. 
To use Pry, we need to add the following line to the code where we want to start debugging:


<br>
{% highlight ruby %}

binding.pry

{% endhighlight %}


<br>
This line will pause the execution of the code and open a Pry console, where we 
can inspect variables, call methods, and execute arbitrary Ruby code.

For example, let's say we have a controller action that's not behaving as expected:


<br>
{% highlight ruby %}

def index
  @posts = Post.all
  @categories = Category.all
end

{% endhighlight %}


<br>
To debug this action with Pry, we can add the <span class="badge">binding.pry</span> 
line after the first line:


{% highlight ruby %}

def index
  binding.pry
  @posts = Post.all
  @categories = Category.all
end

{% endhighlight %}


<br>
When we load the page that triggers this action, the execution will pause at the 
binding.pry line, and we'll be dropped into a Pry console where we can inspect 
the <span class="badge">@posts</span> and <span class="badge">@categories</span> 
variables, call methods on them, and execute arbitrary 
Ruby code to help us debug the issue.


<br>
### Pry Commands

Pry provides several commands that we can use to interact with our code during debugging. Some of the most commonly used commands are:

- ls: List the methods available on an object.
- cd: Change the current context to a different object.
- whereami: Show the current execution context.
- exit: Exit the Pry console.


<br>
### Using Byebug

Byebug works similarly to Pry, but instead of adding a 
<span class="badge">binding.pry</span> line to the code, we add a byebug line:


<br>
{% highlight html %}

def index
  byebug
  @posts = Post.all
  @categories = Category.all
end

{% endhighlight %}



<br>
When we load the page that triggers this action, the execution will pause at the 
byebug line, and we'll be dropped into a Byebug console where we can inspect 
variables, call methods, and execute arbitrary Ruby code to help us debug the issue.

Byebug also includes a number of commands that can help us navigate the code and 
inspect variables. Some of the most commonly used commands are:

- step: Step into the next line of code.
- next: Step over the next line of code.
- finish: Continue executing until the current method returns.
- continue: Continue executing until the next breakpoint or exception.


<br>
Additionally, there are a few tips and best practices to keep in mind when 
debugging with Pry or Byebug:

- Use breakpoints sparingly: Breakpoints can be a powerful tool, but using them 
too frequently can slow down your debugging process. Use them strategically to 
focus on the parts of the code that you suspect are causing the issue.

- Understand the stack trace: When an error occurs, it can be helpful to examine 
the stack trace to see where the error originated. This can help you narrow down 
the source of the problem and guide your debugging efforts.

- Use Pry or Byebug commands: Pry and Byebug both come with a set of useful commands 
that can help you navigate and inspect your code. Familiarize yourself with these 
commands to make debugging faster and more efficient.

- Keep your code organized: Writing clean, organized code can make debugging easier 
by making it easier to follow the flow of your application. Use descriptive variable 
names and break your code up into smaller, more manageable pieces to make it 
easier to debug.


<br>
### Conclusion

Debugging Rails applications can be a challenging and time-consuming task, but 
with the help of tools like Pry and Byebug, we can make the process easier and 
more efficient. By adding <span class="badge">binding.pry</span> or 
<span class="badge">byebug</span> lines to our code, we can pause the execution 
of the code and inspect variables, call methods, and execute arbitrary Ruby code 
to help us diagnose and fix issues.
